### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jose, and I am a 22-year-old electrical engineer with a bachelor's and master's degree. Although my background is in electrical engineering, I have always been fascinated by the world of web development. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

Throughout my academic career, I have gained a strong foundation in programming and electrical engineering principles, and I am excited to apply this knowledge to developing innovative web applications. I am particularly interested in learning new coding languages and frameworks and am always looking for ways to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date on the latest trends in web development.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, collaborating with other developers on open-source projects, or simply learning something new. Thank you for visiting my profile, and I hope to work with you in the future!
